#### Description

DISCLAIMER - I'm currently sick and fighting sleepiness as I post this. As usual, I'll enhance that page with more information when I get better/get back. For now, consider this as a hunting query.

This query returns events where the Terminal Server or TermService may have been tampered with via RDPWrap.

PS: For more immediate context, RDPWrap is used by threat actors' (mostly script kiddies "Ã  la" Phobos however) to patch the Terminal Server/TermService on a Windows system and allow stuff such as concurrent session (which means, if 2 users are already logged in for instance, a 3rd one, the TA could login without prompted the other two to disconnect).

PS 2: This behavior MAY already be detected by Defender for Endpoint (MDE) as a built-in rule. Been a while since I last tested it.
