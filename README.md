# DE-TH-Aura
Repository where I hold random detection and threat hunting queries that I come up with based on different sources of information (or even inspiration).

As of 2024/08/05, since I'm on paternity leave, this repo will be organized in a way that I see fit which means ... it may be all over the place. However, as I add more detection, queries, etc. I'll try to organize it in a way that makes it easier to navigate and find stuff.
