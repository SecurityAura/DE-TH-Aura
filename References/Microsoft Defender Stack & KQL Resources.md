2025/01/09 - Simple list of people who I know share a lot of Microsoft Defender stack-related content and/or KQL content. Trying to have a list of people to follow, but mostly their websites/blogs, that can be shared so that people can watch for new publications and learn about all the cool stuff that can be done with Defender/KQL.
